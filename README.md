PHP Lenient Parser
==================

This is a PHP 5.2 to PHP 7.1 parser written in PHP. It handles some partial and
illegal code, producing partial syntax tree. Its purpose is to simplify static
code analysis and manipulation.

As this is just a parser replacement for [PHP Parser](https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser),
go there for actual documentation.


Installation
------------

The preferred installation method is [composer](https://getcomposer.org):

    php composer.phar require tsufeki/php-lenient-parser
